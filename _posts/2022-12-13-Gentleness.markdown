Surgical skill evaluation is highly qualitative and
subjective in its current state. In the field of pediatric congenital
heart surgery, surgical skill and dexterity are directly related
to the level of gentleness used while operating on the sensitive
tissue of young children. We propose a method for quantifying
gentleness in surgical procedures to eliminate its qualitative and
subjective nature. The proposed method is based on video-based
motion analysis of surgeons with varying skill levels (i.e. a highly
experienced pediatric cardio-thoracic surgeon, a recently certi-
fied pediatric cardio-thoracic surgeon, and a complete novice).
The motion analysis was that of the participants’ dominant
and non-dominant hands during a surgical procedure known
as an anastomosis, where two Lifelike femoral artery structures
were bridged together through suturing. We consider a number
of different metrics when building our gentleness model (e.g.
mean linear acceleration, mean jerk, linear acceleration stan-
dard deviation, jerk standard deviation,path length, and time
span). Through data analysis, we saw statistically significant
differences between the participants’ non-dominant hand usage
during the surgical procedure. Furthermore, we saw statistically
significant differences in the timespan of the needle being passed
through the model tissue during the anastomosis procedure.
These results show quantitative differences in the surgical
dexterity of the participants. Furthermore, this study sets a
general framework for a quantitative analysis of gentleness
during anastomosis procedures
