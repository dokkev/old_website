This is extended project from [Autonomous Fire Figihgting Robot Arm](https://dokkev.github.io/firefigther-robot/) to improve fire sensing. The previous project limited fire sensing to 2D imaging, but this project extends to localizing the fire in 3D location relative to the robot and the world frame.

You can check out the source code from the [Github Repository](https://github.com/dokkev/Fire_3D_Tracking)
