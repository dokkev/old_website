This project aims simulating a humanoid robot's walking and balancing using Whole Body Control (WBC) and Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) planner using URDF models of Boston Dynamics' ATLAS in PyBullet enviroment. This project was implemented from [PyPnC](https://github.com/junhyeokahn/PyPnC) as a part of The Unversity of Texas as Austin's Design and Control of Human Centered Robotics (ASE389) course.


# Humanoid Modeling under Multi-Contact Constraints
Challenges in humanoid robot involve high dimensionality, underactuation, and operation under geometrical and multi-contact constraints. A humanoid robot’s behavior is determined by not only the dispalcements of its articulated joints, but also interactions of its bodies in contact.

*Figure 1: Kinematic representation of a humanoid robot The free moving base is represented as a virtual spherical joint in series with three prismatic virtual joints. Reaction forces appear at the contact points due to gravity forces pushing the body against the ground. Contact constraints are expressed as rigid constraints with zero velocities and accelerations at the supporting bodies [1].*

The equation of motion which is subjected to acutation torques and external forces can be derived using Euler-Lagrange equation

where A is the (n + 6) × (n + 6) inertia matrix, b and g are (n + 6) × 1 vectors of Coriolis/centrifugal and gravity forces.
