Hello! My name is Dongho Kang (DK), a full-stack robotician at Northwestern University.
I graduated in BS in Mechanical Enginnering at Saint Louis University in 2020, I am currently working on MS in Robotics at NU.

During my time at Northwestern University, I focused my research topics on sensing and manipulation. 
My [Autonomous Fire Fighter Robot Arm](https://dokkev.github.io/firefigther-robot/) project aims integrating a fire safety feature to a common robotic arm manipulator that can be widely used in various settings such as warehouses, garages, and houses. I believe that making robots cope with emergency situations like fire is an important step for robots to operate and co-operate with huamn in our daily lives. 

Another my big interest in robotics comes in devleoping bio-inspired senosrs or robots. My final project [Whisker-based Tactile Sensing Simulation](https://dokkev.github.io/Digital-Rat-Whisker-Simulation/) focuses on understanding dynamic data that a rat obtains through whisking over different shapes of objects and integrating those data to implement exploration algorithm for a rat in a simulation.  Rats use whiskers to navigate thorugh holes and find open space, As they scan, their whiskers make unexpected contact with an object, and the rat then explores the object to extract the details of its shape. The use of whisker inputs to detect, localize, and extract the spatial properties of objects. Whiksers allow rats to operate in complete darkness<sup>1</sup>, and I think that integrating these features to implement whisker-inspired tacile sensors can benefit robotic navigation and explortation technology.


### Future Goals
I hope to purse Ph.D. to investiage soft actuators and tacile sensing after my Master studies. Soft actuators have enormous potential to expand the capabilities of robotic manipulation. Having an infinite number of degrees of freedom and a non-rigid body allow robots to interact with environments flexibly. Therefore, I would like to research the fabrication and control of soft actuators to reduce cost and accelerate actuation speed for soft robotic applications while current soft actuators face problems such as idleness and bulkiness from their complicated actuation mechanism.

While human hands can grab a wide variety of shapes and sizes thanks to multiple fingers with multiple degrees of freedom and especially our control capability with tactile and force sensing<sup>2</sup>, the existing gripper manipulator lacks mechanical input such as target objectâ€™s shape, size, mass, etc. Tactile sensing enables the measurement of information necessary for dexterous manipulation, and I hope to leverage tactile sensing technology with researching tactile sensors which can be integrated into the tip of the robot manipulator.
