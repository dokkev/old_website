Hello! My name is Dongho Kang (DK), a full-stack robotician at Northwestern University.
I graduated in BS in Mechanical Engineering at Saint Louis University in 2020, I am currently working on MS in Robotics

During my time at Northwestern University, I focused my research topics on whisker-based tactile sensing, manipulation, and robotic perception.

My big interest in robotics comes in developing robots and sensors inspired from animals. My final project [Whisker-based Tactile Mapping and localization ](https://dokkev.github.io/Digital-Rat-Whisker-Simulation/) at Northwestern focuses on understanding dynamic data that a rat obtains through whisking over different shapes of objects and integrating those data to implement tactile mapping and localization algorithm for a rat in a simulation. Rats use whiskers to navigate through holes and find open space. As they scan, their whiskers make unexpected contact with an object, and the rat then explores the object to extract the details of its shape. The use of whisker inputs to detect, localize, and extract the spatial properties of objects. These unique features allow rats to operate in complete darkness<sup>1</sup>, and I hope to integrate these features into robotics research for robotic navigation.

My [Autonomous Fire Fighter Robot Arm](https://dokkev.github.io/firefigther-robot/) project aims integrating a fire safety feature to a common robotic arm manipulator that can be widely used in various settings such as warehouses, garages, and houses. I believe that making robots cope with emergency situations like fire is an important step for robots to operate and cooperate with humans in our daily lives. I believe that robotic perception 

### Research Interests
I hope to pursue a Ph.D. to investigate dexterous robotic manipulation after my Master studies. 

<strong>Adaptive Grasping with Dynamic Tactile Sensing</strong>
While human hands can grab a wide variety of shapes and sizes thanks to multiple fingers with multiple degrees of freedom and especially our control capability with tactile and force sensing<sup>2</sup>, the existing gripper manipulator lacks mechanical input such as target objectâ€™s shape, size, mass, etc. Tactile sensing enables the measurement of information necessary for dexterous manipulation. Dynamic tactile sensing is especially important in robotic manipulation. When a human throws and catches an object, or when someone is grasping an object and it slips or falls out. Those sorts of events occur in a short duration of time, and dynamic tactile sensing comes useful with its capability to quickly respond to changes. Therefore, I hope to leverage dexterous robotic manipulation through researching dynamic tactile sensing for my doctoral studies.

<strong>Control of Soft Actuator</strong>
Soft actuators have enormous potential to expand the capabilities of robotic manipulation. Having an infinite number of degrees of freedom and a non-rigid body allow robots to interact with environments flexibly. Therefore, I would like to research the fabrication and control of soft actuators to reduce cost and accelerate actuation speed for soft robotic applications while current soft actuators face problems such as idleness and bulkiness from their complicated actuation mechanism.
