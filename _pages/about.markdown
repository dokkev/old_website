Hello! My name is Dongho Kang (DK), a robotician at Northwestern University.
I graduated in BS in Mechanical Enginnering at Saint Louis University in 2020, I am currently working on MS in Robotics.
During my time at Northwestern University, I focused my research topics on sensing and manipulation. 

My [Autonomous Fire Fighter Robot Arm](https://rubberdk.github.io/firefigther-robot/) project aims integrating a fire safety feature to a common robotic arm manipulator that can be widely used in various settings such as warehouses, garages, and houses. I believe that making robots cope with emergency situations like fire is an important step for robots to operate in our daily lives. 


## Research Interest
 - Sensing and Manipulation
 - Bio-inspired Robotics/Soft Robotics
 - Human Robot Collaboration 
 - Human-Robot Interaction
